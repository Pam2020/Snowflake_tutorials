Cost types/cost depends on:
Standard Edition:2.7/credit
Enterprise:4/credit
Business critical-5.4/credit
Virtual private snowflake

Region
cloud paltform where account is hosted
Virtual warehouse size

Storage Cost
compute Cost
cloud services COST

Storage:

On demand-as you use you charge 1TB/$40
Capacity or fixed Storage 1TB/$23
100GB-0.1 TB
first we need to start with On demand . once our application is stable then switch to Capacity storage to save the dollars
compute cost:
 
depends on virtual warehouse usage per month
Billed per seconds with 1 minute minimum
Credit usgae per hour:

xsmall-1 credit per hour
small-2credit per hour
medium-4 credit
large-8
XL-16
2xL-32
3XL-64
4XL-128
5XL-256
6XL-512

cost optimization
choose appropriate Edition
start with On demand then capacity Storage
Choose WH
Dev-xs with 2 clusters
Test-Xs with 4 clusters or s with 2 clusters
prd-m or L

Small queries-choose smallest size with more number of clusters
Few big queries on large data sets-choose large size with less clusters
many big queries-choose Lagre size with more clusters

table stypes:
Transient tables for STGing
Transient tables for intermeduiate data processings
less data retention periods
use cloing effectively
turn off time travel before dropping the table
make use of results cache
use auto suspend timouts based query frequency

Performance optimization:
Define cluster keys
Define cluster keys on large tables not in small tables
define cluster keys on most frequently used columns as filter
define cluster keys on Join key
define  cluster keys on function based on columns
select required columns
replace or with UNION
union all is always beteer if there are no duplicates on data
avoid unneccessray joins
avoid distinct if you are sure no duplicates

Dataloading:
Load types:
Bulk loading->copy
continuous loading->Snow pipe

Copy Command:
Copy into table name from @Stage
file_format=(...)
files=(filename1,filename2)
(or)
pattern='.*filepattern.*'
other_optional_props;

Location of files:
Local Env:files are first staged in Snowflake stage the loaded into table
AWS S3:Files can be loaded directly from any s3 bucket
GCP-files can be loaded directly from any cloud storgae container
Azure-files can beloaded directly from any azure container

File types:
CSV,TSV,JSON,AVRO,ORC,PARQUET,XML

Simple Transformations:
Column reordering
column omisiion
string operations
Other functions
